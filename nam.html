          Home of the brave, and land of the free. Also home to the most diverse cultures and lifestyles compared to any continent, in my opinion. Even though it technically only has three countries: Canada, U.S.A, and Mexico, the United States alone represents snapshots of all ethnicities and cultures smeared throughout from New York to Los Angeles. You can find hints of asia, africa, south america and most dominantly europe scattered throughout the continent. Although tensions sometimes arise, the love within the populus is more than enough to hold it all together.</p>

          <h3 id="Col">Colorado, United States of America</h3>
          <article>
            <p>
              Colorado is a mini switzerland with sprinkles of Amsterdam and a whole lot of paradise. This delicious blend of landscape and culture is simply beautiful. My friends and I embarked on a road trip from Delaware (the state, not Delaware, Ohio) to Colorado. The road trip itself had noteworthy moments but I will focus mainly on Colorado itself. Colorado is in the mountainous region of the United States, nicknamed, “The Rockies”. Colorado has been the home of Nikola Tesla during his reclusive years and currently houses one of the most innovative growing hubs in technology, Denver. The state has got it all: beautiful landscape (check), friendly people (check), best skiing in the country (check), cheap land (check), and best of all recreational marijuana is legal (this where sprinkles of Amsterdam comes into play).

            </ul>
            <p>
              Be sure to visit during the winter for some of the best skiing/snowboarding west of the Alps. Also, there is most likely X-games going on in Aspen (or the general region around Aspen) so that’s unique. We skied in the Keystone resort and had an absolute blast. I am not the most skilled skier, so I didn’t get to enjoy the obstacle courses and innovative slopes but rest assured, it’s a good resort for any skill level. In terms of finance, you can make Colorado work on a relatively inexpensive budget. We booked hastily at cheap motels from our car (thank god for technology) and got really lucky. It wasn’t all smooth sailing though, there were many times when it was 12 am and we had no where to stay, so we just kept on searching and eventually got lucky. To avoid this hassle, be sure to plan ahead of time. Also driving is honestly the best way to explore Colorado (as is the case with most of the U.S).
            </p>
            <p> In terms of visiting Colorado’s beautiful landscapes and enjoying its many offerings, I would recommend going to the garden of the gods. The park is absolutely beautiful and you reignite your youthful spirit by traversing the rocky terrain and exploring cool little natural gems. We saw some avid rock climbers crawling against gravity at ridiculous heights. The elevation was enough to make my stomach tingle and be happy to on firm ground. If you are a rock climber, you definitely wish to plod up these vertical rocks. Besides rock climbing, Denver is also a great time to eat, drink and “enjoy” the local attractions. On our last day we manage to find an ice skating party and had blast. Like many other cities in the world, Denver has no shortage of events for you to participate in. So let the city and rolling rockies take your on a journey to self discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
            SIDE NOTE: If you are driving from the Northeast to Colorado. Stop by St. Louis Rooftop 360 bar and order the best dark beer in the world (it’s called “Chocolate Milk Stout” by 4 Hand Brewing Company)

          <h3 id="Mon">Montreal, Canada</h3>
          <p>Montreal offers individuals a compact snapshot of Europe and lives up to the famous canadian hospitality. Once we arrived we visited many of the touristy spots listed on tripadvisor. The city itself is very walkable. The city is littered with giant cathedrals, awesome restaurants and oozes a friendly atmosphere.So eat tons of poutine, and enjoy some delicious crepes. Montreal boasts a famous deli called “Schwartz’s deli” and it has the best smoked sandwich you will ever eat. The sandwich (pictured in this article) is supremely satisfying and is served with the crispiest of the fries. Our experience was a bit amplified because it was cold and rainy outside, hence, we enjoyed that warm, deliciously satisfying sandwich with utmost urgency. SIDE NOTE: the deli is cash only so please bring cash! The area surrounding Schwartz’s deli, also has some great restaurants and bars which can definitely make your trip to montreal more memorable.
          </p>

          </ul>
          <p>Once all of the touristy things are out of the way, do more touristy things and check out “Old Montreal”. As the name would suggest, Old Montreal is the oldest area in the entire city of Montreal. You can walk along the harbor and checkout some more awesome bars and eat some more.
          </p>
          <ul class="gallery">

            </ul>
          <p>Overall, Montreal is a great party city. It's a city meant for having fun and letting loose. Try their maple syrup flavored whiskey; it is extremely dangerous because it tastes really good but it is definitely really strong. Word of caution when purchasing liquor, there is only like one store that you can buy your liquor from and even that has limited hours, so be sure to buy ahead of time. When you wish to buy beer, just check out your local grocery store and they should have more than enough beer to last you a lifetime. However, one of the times when you aren’t drinking and eating, be sure to check out their art museum and other historic districts which will shoot you right back in time.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Phil">Philadelphia, U.S.A</h3>
          <p>Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. Philly has the great honor of always playing second fiddle to New York. Both cities are situated by the water, both have their own set of traditions and most importantly both are a lot of fun. I am a bit biased because I favor Philly over New York mainly because it’s cheaper and more accessible than New York. Driving into New York is a nightmare, compare that to Philly, not so much. If you are flying in, then they are both on par since both have airports nearby the city.  Regarding expenses, New York is notoriously expensive in all fronts, even chipotle. So, besides beating New York is accessibility and price, Philly also has many other things that make it a better city *gasp*
          </p>
          <p>
            I love Philadelphia. Besides the logical (accessibility and price) reasons, Philly also the title of being one of the most historically important city in the U.S. The constitution of the U.S as well as the Declaration of Independence was signed here! Considering that, one might say, it is the most important city in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quite literally, Philly has been at it since the dawn of the United States. It holds incredible historical value and all of this is definitely visitable. I.E definitely visit the Liberty hall, independence hall, the museums, and most importantly the rocky steps (not really historic in any real sense but historic in every sense that really matters).
          </p>
          <p>
             Philadelphia has something for everyone, though it can’t compete with DC in terms of museums, Philly does have the best exhibit/museum in the world (obviously in my opinion, duh). The Franklin institute is BETTER THAN DISNEY WORLD! (again my opinion). It has everything a curious mind loves; this includes knowledge, entertainment and most importantly interactive exhibits!
           </p>
             <ul id="franklin-list">
               <li>You want to know how skiing works? Learn it at the Franklin!</li>
               <li>Wanna see a walkable heart exhibit and pretend you are blood going through a heart? Do it at the Franklin!</li>
               <li>Want to find transmit electricity and possibly shock your friends(lightheartedly)? You got it, Franklin Institute</li>
             </ul>
          <p>
            No I don’t have any sponsorship from the Franklin Institute but if they want to give me some free tickets, I wouldn’t mind. Jokes aside, it is an incredibly fun experience for all ages. You can see how surgeries happen, how the brain works, travel the galaxy with a guided planetarium tour, etc. It really is a lot of sober fun!
          </p>
          <p>Now after you are done with all the nerdy stuff, Philly also has awesome nightclubs and bars. Some of the many spots that are awesome: XFinity Live (ride a mechanical bull here), The Graffiti bar, Rumor, Cuba Libre (also at DC), and Fiduk’s (just to mention a few). They all have a premium feel and the prices aren’t too bad. Best times to visit are during the 4th of July celebration, Made in America concert or St. Patty’s day. I visited Philly during St. Patty’s day and it was wicked fun. During St. Patty’s day, Philly runs “Erin Express”, which is pretty much a bunch of school buses that help you bar hop. Best of all it’s free!
          </p>
          <p>Overall, Philly is a great time when it comes to partying or just nerding out (why not both?). </p>

          <h3 id="DC">Washington DC, U.S.A</h3>
          <p>The capital of the United States of America. Washington DC is a paradise for anyone who loves history and good stories. In my opinion, DC is possibly the best city in the United States. It has it all; seasons, history, attractions, significance, good restaurants, good clubs and most definitely great bars (I am looking at you pop-up G.O.T bar). DC houses the three branches of government that make the USA run. On top of that, most government agencies are headquartered here. This makes this city one of the most, if not the most significant cities in the world. The amount of power that sits in this city is incalculable. Besides that, it features some of the greatest museums in the world! You can spend a week just at the “Mall” (the lawn outlined by the museums) and still have much to go. The sheer amount of memorials, museums, galleries, and attractions that exists in such a small area is insane. When we visited, we walked over 25 miles in just that one day. You could make it less gruesome by better planning out your path and renting a bike rather than walking everywhere.
          </p>
          <ul class="gallery">
            <li><a href="pics/DC/themall.jpg"><img src="pics/DC/themall.jpg" alt="The Mall"></a></li>
            <li><a href="pics/DC/washington.jpg"><img src="pics/DC/washington.jpg" alt="The Washington Monument"></a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Besides the nerdy stuff, DC also has awesome night clubs as well as hookah bars (if you are into that). I am not a big fan of hookah but my friends are so we went to a hookah bar/nightclub that charge a ridiculous entry fee (not a fan of cover charge). They also have a latin club (also exists in Philadelphia) called Cuba Libre. Cuba Libre has very good music and amazing drinks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The food is impressive as well but honestly nothing spectacular. A lot of it is pretty straightforward. Besides the history and the government, DC is just another city filled with good restaurants and bars. In a gist, if you come here, you will learn a thing or two (about history or science) and will definitely have fun.
