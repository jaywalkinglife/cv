        Hello, my name is Jay Bhatt and I am a recent college graduate with a passion for learning and adventures. My favorite topics to learn about include: money, food, travel, mechanical engineering, and computer science. This blog is a personal project of mine to help me get better at coding (HTML & CSS), writing and cooking.  Since this project, combines ⅘ of my favorite topics, hope you have as much fun reading it as I will writing it!
      </p>

        <h1 id="mt">Who is this blog for?</h1>
        <p> People who are interested in getting to understand how to tackle life while maintaining some sort of wealth, health and most importantly themselves.
        </p>

        <p>	This blog is a work in progress and as I learn to add additional features to this project, the better it should get. My next big step is to add a comments section so be on the lookout for that.
          Currently, I don’t know how to sign people up for a newsletter so for now if you want to just bookmark this page, that’d be great :)
        </p>

          Thank you for reading this and if at any stage of your visit, a wall of writing seems like too much, just look at the pretty pictures. I am working on making the articles shorter! Currently, I have the most amount of content in travel but I am also working on adding more things to food and money!
