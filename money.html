      <p> If ask anyone, they'd agree, money is a great precursor to a happy life. However, if not managed or utilized properly (efficiently), it can bring more harm than good. Spending money to fill holes in your life that are caused by the lack of relationships is a bad idea. Spending money to establish better connections or going on adventures is a great idea. I state these two thing because, I don’t want you to think that money = happiness.
      </p>
      <p>Money, like most things in life, is an essential tool to achieve happiness. In my experience money typically coincides with happiness because without it, life can be tough. So, in this blog I want to discuss tips and tricks I have learned from my few short years in the real world. Investing is a subpage in which I want to discuss investing in the broadest of the terms. Thoughts are obviously, my thoughts on money
