        And the award for the most influential continent goes to: Europe! Owning much of the world at one point, the continent has been a backdrop for countless wars and conquests. Also home to revered civilizations ranging from the Greeks, to the Romans, to the Vikings. In sheer numbers, Europe is home to over 50 countries. Despite such a large amount of countries, with its superb Eurail system, a centralized currency and visa-free travel, it is an absolute delight for a globetrotter.

        <h4>Key tips for Europe</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>This tip is primarily for backpackers through Europe. If you are going to travel around in Europe, purchase and write in PEN for your Eurail Pass. Firstly, Eurail pass is this awesome train ticket substitute in which you can pick a set amount of days of travel within a set duration of time. For example, you could select “5 days of travel in a 14 day period”. If you select this option, then you are purchasing 5 days worth of travel within a 2 week. A day of travel is essentially a free train pass on any international or national train in Europe for the entire duration of the day (24 hours). It’s a pretty sweet deal but the caveat is that you have to select neighbouring countries and your Eurail pass is only good for those countries that you selected. This means that you wish to travel from Amsterdam to Geneva and your path takes you through France, you must have these three regions selected on your pass. Even if your final destination might not be in France, it does not matter, if you are going pass through that country, you must select it in your pass. You could just purchase the ticket if it seems stupid to waste a whole country on your pass. Now that you have an idea of how the Eurail pass works, you also have to remember the rules that comes with the pass. One of these major rules is that they ask you to write in PEN the path to mean to take before you board. The conductor will simply look at your pass and confirm that you have properly documented the use of the day on your pass and be on his merry way. However, if you did not write it in or simply wrote it in pencil he WILL TEAR YOUR $500+ PASS INTO SHREDS. We didn’t know when we boarded from Berlin to Amsterdam that we had to WRITE IT IN PEN. When the conductor got to us, I had to literally beg him not to tear my pass into pieces. Luckily after 15 terrifying minutes, he agreed to let it go. Also, you have to get the Eurail pass activated/stamped before you can start using it.I don’t know if you can really do it online but make sure you get it done before boarding. It can typically be done by someone at the offices in any train station. Please note that lines are notoriously long at these offices and there is almost always a long queue, so definitely visit the day before you are traveling. We got lucky with a German translator who was able to translate the urgency. I know it seems like a lot but trust me, Eurail pass is the way to go if you plan on backpacking through Europe.
          </li>
          <li>This tip goes along with the previous tip about backpacking through Europe. Download the free Eurail app! It is extremely helpful and it works offline. Its algorithms are designed to get you from point A to point B. Be cautious in your use of these paths as the app does not account for the fact that you only have the one allotted day for your Eurail pass or that you pass might not accommodate all the countries you will be travelling through. Let’s say you are traveling from Amsterdam to Geneva and you bought a pass for Germany, Netherlands (this one's group into three countries which includes Luxemburg and Belgium), Switzerland, and Italy. The Eurail pass will take you straight through France which will COST YOU EXTRA SINCE YOU DID NOT PURCHASE FRANCE. It doesn't matter that you are merely passing through. Not that this happened to us.
          </li>
          <li>Booking hostels: This is a great option if you are traveling on a budget and you want to interact with fellow travellers. Hostels are cheap and if you plan ahead you can actually get hotel quality rooms. For example, in Venice, we got a double room (for two people) with a private bathroom and shower for approximately $10 each. Not to say there aren’t any bad hostels out there. I had a bad experience with hostels in Amsterdam, we didn’t book ahead of time so we were charged ridiculous money for the beds (or else we would’ve been homeless) and my bed was infested with bed bugs. So, plan ahead and read reviews to get the best hostel deals. Hostels are, in my opinion, the best way to lodge in Europe. My favorite hostel experience had to be in Milan at Hostel Colors. They had free breakfast (we never made it) and an awesome lounge area which served as catalyst for amazing social interactions.

            <h3 id="Ber">Berlin, Germany</h3>
            <p>
              To state the obvious, Berlin is the capital of Germany. The city carries nostalgic but modern vibe. Berlin houses strange juxtaposition of historical sites with random fast food establishments and malls. Being in such a glamourous city, it’s easy to forget that it was bombarded by the Allies and the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church is a ghostly remnant of those trying times. It’s bit of an eerie experience, as the church stands still in time while the world around it persevere ahead. In many instances, Berlin has really showcased the persistence of the human spirit. It has been there for the recovery from a hateful regime, its flirtation with a grossly different economic doctrines to what it is now, a economic and a moral powerhouse for all of Europe.  Speaking of economic doctrines, Berlin obviously has the “Berlin Wall”. The once formidable wall now stands mocked by artists who have turned it into a canvas for tolerance, acceptance, and love. Obviously if you find yourself in Berlin, you have to walk the wall.
            </p>
            <ul class="gallery">
              <li><a href="pics/Ber/panda.jpg"><img src="pics/Ber/panda.jpg" alt="Berlin Wall"> </a></li>
              <li><a href="pics/Ber/face.jpg"><img src="pics/Ber/face.jpg" alt="Berlin Wall"></a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              On a more whimsical note, when you find yourself in Berlin and you decide to visit a local bakery, please remember that there are LIVE BEES in the store. They ferment the “flavor” on top of the bakery items(no joke). For me, this was an insane experience. The bakers and the staff were doing their thing as the customers were in a perfect waiting to order their food. Everybody was indifferent to the bees (which is what you are supposed to do), I was very much different because of the bees. SIDE TRACK: When I was younger, I got a chase a bee hive and ever since then, it's a very rational fear I have about bees. There was even an instance in my college career where there were two bees outside of my dorm entrance, I decided just not to go to any classes that day.  </p>
            <p>
              Back to Berlin though, food in Berlin felt heavily influenced by the Middle East. Their favorite street food is “Duna” and “Currywurst”.  They also have your typical selection of german sausages: bratwurst, rostbratwurst, etc. You will find these street foods everywhere! Be aware though, Duna and Currywurst is spicy.
            </p>

            </ul>
            <p>Now onto what Germany is famous for: Beer. My experience regarding Beer in germany was fairly tamed. To be honest, I went many bars and restaurants and their selection of beers pales in comparison to what is offered at my local bars. On average they had about three beers on tap and few more on bottles. This is a sharp contrast to what I envisioned the German beer scene. I honestly expected more out of the Roman colony that stuck to making beer when Rome told them to switch to wine (Source: SYSK: How Beer Works). No matter the history, no country can beat America’s insatiable desire for choices and consumption. Not to mislead you though, Germany boasts a spectacular nightlife. At the time of our visit, Straight Outta Compton had just been released. It was a BIG deal in Berlin. They actually had a special "Straight Outta Berlin" themed party at a prominent club. We tried to enter this party but unfortunately this party was sold out and we couldn't sneak in. Either way, we visited an awesome rooftop bar near the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church and cherished the view of a drenched Berlin. Afterwards, we went out with some locals and had a great time. My friend freestyled on the open mic and we got free drinks and met some enigmatic individuals (to say the least).
            </p>
            <p>Overall, Berlin is a great city. It boasts an impressively diverse history. The people are friendly and eager to help tourists navigate their hometown. When you visit, just make sure you don’t leave without eating a kinder bar, and grabbing your obligatory Berlin Wall souvenir. </p>

            <h3 id="Ams">Amsterdam, Netherlands</h3>
            <p>
              Amsterdam is a haven for outsiders and the creative pariahs. The dominance of art and progressive ideas flow through the streets of Amsterdam. True to the standard European stereotype, everyone dresses to impress. My friend & I were representing America well with sport shorts and T-shirts. At Max Euweplein square, right in front of the Hard Rock Cafe, is a giant chess board where you can play life size chess with locals and travellers alike. It’s called Max Euweplein square for Max Euweplein, a famous dutch chess player, hence the giant chess board in his square. The streets of Amsterdam are littered with street artists, local vendors, and outdoor seating for the restaurants. Speaking of restaurants, beware of the cheap prices! The food is relatively inexpensive but the drinks can get you! In Amsterdam, apparently, it's a law that you have to buy a drink when ordering food at a restaurant. Hence, the restaurants lure you in with cheap food but upcharge the drinks, even water. Believe it or not, if you are enjoying the city and need a bite, kindly make your way over to the Burger King located by the Bulldog coffee shop. It has some of the best chicken sandwiches and since it's fast food, no ridiculous laws of drinks apply (apparently). I know it seems crazy to suggest Burger King when visiting Amsterdam but at the time of our visit, that was the only thing we could afford that would really fill us up. Another piece of advice is not to rely on last minute hostel beds being open. My friend & I had to purchase expensive hostel beds for our stay and those beds were riddled with bed bugs!!! Overall, book ahead of time and purchase food wisely.

            </ul>
            <p>
              During our visit we just walked around and just absorbed the culture. The presence of bicycles and electric cars is prominent throughout Amsterdam. As a result, the air in such a populous city is fresh and, in a sense, friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Amsterdam also has the infamous Red Light District. One must go just for curiosity sake. It is definitely an interesting experience to see such a taboo aspect of society handled so elegantly. It is an out of the world experience but make sure to visit the Red Light district during the night time for the full effect of such a bewildering idea put into practice. If you don’t know what that “bewildering idea” is, google it.

            </ul>
            <p>
              Lastly, check out the Van Gogh museum, my friend & I had the misfortune of only having two hours to check out the museum but give yourself a whole afternoon with a clear mindset to really appreciate and remember the paintings. We also never made it to the Anne Frank’s museum, just ran out of time, but everyone told us it’s a jarring experience and I can’t wait to go back and pay my respects. Afterwards, partake in the recreational activities offered in Amsterdam.Be sure to try the pastries offered at “The Rookies Coffeeshop”. Also, speaking of pastries, please do not leave Amsterdam without eating macarons!
            </p>
            <p>SIDE NOTE: the last picture in this article is not Amsterdam, its actually Brussels, Belgium. I just couldn't help but put it in this article because I discovered this incredibly clean and stunning city in my travels out of Amsterdam to Geneva. And I didn't really have any awesome pictures left in my arsenal from Amsterdam :( </p>

            <p>Geneva, Switzerland is truly a place of extreme opulence. This was a bad spot to go to for my friend and I since at the time we were pretty close to broke. During our trip we really only ate croissants from McCafe (it’s an actual Cafe in Europe!). A McDouble which costs a dollar in the United States was approximately nine whole dollars in Geneva! However with the opulence you definitely could sense that everyone around you is affluent. There were fancy castles (not houses, CASTLES!) which turned out to be hotels and cannons randomly placed within the cobblestone streets. Expensive and exotic cars were parallel parked throughout the immaculate streets. They had an outdoor mall on the French side which consisted of vendors such as Rolex, Bvlgarvia, and other random Euro-centric brands. However, despite the incredible high cost of living, we were able to score a free room with my friend’s dad who happened to be in town for a conference (he is in academia).
            </p>

            </ul>
            <p>Most importantly, we went to go visit the Jet D'eau. Jet D'eau is the shining star of Geneva, Switzerland. It is a massive man-made spring which was originally created as a solution for excess pressure from a nearby plant. As life goes, the jet turned into a signature attraction for the city. It dispenses approximately 130 gallons of water into the crystal clear Lake Geneva. It is definitely worth a visit. I would recommend visiting when you have money to blow because trust me, that’s really the only way you can truly enjoy Geneva. The UN headquarters is also located in Geneva, Switzerland (we were only able to see the bland building from the outside). A cultural tip: Switzerland does not officially have a language. Geneva itself is surrounded by France. Hence, the primary language spoken in Geneva is French. In Geneva, there isn’t a lot to do, except for visiting fancy cathedrals and luxurious park benches. True to the nature of Switzerland, Geneva is a peaceful location with not much night life that we encountered. I would recommend this as a pit stop but not as a full blown vacation location.

            <h3 id="Ven">Venice, Italy</h3>
            <p>Americans know this city as Venice but the locals call it Venezia. Hence, I will refer to it as Venezia. This is my second favorite place I visited on my backpacking trip through Europe (#1 will always be Amsterdam). Venezia is stupidly beautiful. It is possibly the only city, in my opinion, that can come close to rivaling Amsterdam. Venezia itself is located off of the eastern shore of Italy. It can be reached through the train or the car bridge. Please note that there are no streets in Venezia. The streams of water that cut through the landmass are the streets of this ancient city. The taxis are gondolas and public transportation is a not-so-fancy ferry. Our trip to Venezia was fairly cheap. The drastic difference in our expenditure is due to us learning our lessons. By the time we get to Venizia, we’d already travelled to Berlin, Amsterdam, and Geneva. We felt a bit seasoned from our travels and didn’t make the same mistake twice. We made new ones. We booked our hostel ahead of time and were lucky enough to score a private room for low cost. However with no internet to research great spots, we just kinda went with the flow. We checked out one of the many towering cathedrals located in Venezia; One of those towering cathedrals, provided me with the beautiful snapshot of Venezia shown below.

            <p>Like Geneva, nightlife in Venezia is also sort of non-existent. We walked around to search for a club but found out that Venezia only has a few bars that are hip/popping. All others are fancy restaurants who serve good wine and great food. We visited a local bar and had great drinks and met mostly tourists. On that night we actually ended up getting lost in Venezia and after two hours of mindless walking we were able to locate a ferry stop half way into the city. We hitched a ride back to our island (our hostel was located on a different island than the main) at like 4 am. So a good tip, if you ever get lost in the city, just find a ferry stop and then you’ll be able to deduce your way out of your predicament. </p>
            <p>
            Overall, Venezia is worth a visit on any budget and plus the food and gelato are probably some of the best in the country. Also note, wine is cheaper here than drinking water, so DRINK AWAY TYRION!

            <p>I didn’t find any amazingly cool locations in this city. The best experience of the trip was honestly just simply getting lost in the city at night. Be sure to just walk around and take different turns to fully experience the floating city on water. Like I said before, if you get lost just look for the public ferry stop. </p>

            <h3 id="Mil">Milan, Italy</h3>
            <p>Milan, locally known as, Milan, is a great city for inspiration and shopping. By the time we arrived in Milan we were weathered and experienced from our long journey. Through our experience we made sure we stayed at the best rated hostel for the cheapest price.
            </p>
            <p>
              We stayed at Hostel Colors which offered free breakfast and had a general lounge area for its guests. We met extraordinary people in this lounge who were from all walks of life: one Australian who had been traveling for a month and just enjoying Europe, a seventeen year old kid from the NYC who was traveling by himself for two months to “find himself”, two crazy girls from Belgium living life to the fullest after their college and so many more. Besides our awesome meets, we had the privilege to visit the Milan Cathedral.

              We visited as soon as we got to Milan at night and then spent the full day walking around the next day. Again, like all cities on our trip, the streets were littered with amazing street artists. This time around, the street artists sort of amplified the experience of this majestic Cathedral. The cathedral itself is massive and showcases a tremendous amount of craftsmanship and artistry. Every little man and animal carved into the walls of this wonder is carefully detailed and simply breathtaking. With this gigantic art project in front of us, the street artist began to play Beethoven’s fifth symphony. This combination thrusted the visitors into another realm of inspiration and possibilities. I, myself was inspired to continue my travels and never stop aspiring to be better because of that day. Although, I can’t guarantee that there will an amazing street artist on the day you visit, but the chances are, the Cathedral will definitely move you emotionally, and intellectually to be better than your current you. Isn’t that truly the point of traveling?

            <p>As we walked the surrounding area, we actually stumbled upon a really cool bar/grocery store/fiat museum. As pictured above, there were cool Fiat exhibits and really good drinks at the attached bar. There was an outdoor live DJ, games (table tennis, badminton, etc.), and a very chill vibe. I don't remember the exact name of the place but it is nearby the cathedral and if you can find it, have a good time!</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Honestly, besides the Milan Cathedral and its surroundings, there isn’t really much else to do in Milan. You could go shop but my favorite thing to do was simply just walk around the city and get a feel for it. </p>

            <h3 id="Ice">Iceland</h3>
            <p>Iceland is a feast for the eyes and the tummy. It is by far the coolest country I have ever been to. Before this trip, I had never been in a country where the sun rose at 11:00 am and set at 3:00 pm. Never before did I run between two tectonic plates, hike a mountain, and relax in a natural hot tub, all in the same day. My Icelandic trip was by far the most amazing, mostly due to the gigantic group of people I was able to convince to come with me. For some reason seven of my closest friends agreed to go to Iceland in the middle of winter where there is very little daylight and there is only one major city. Most nights we partied in Reykjavik, the other we explored the beautiful golden circle. In Iceland, you really get the sense of the globe, the night sky concaves around you and the stars cloak you with their beauty and immenseness. It was tough for us to find a clear night but when we did, we were able to see Aurora Borealis (The Northern Lights). There is a website to track Aurora Borealis but honestly, I couldn’t make much sense of it. From our talks with the locals, they recommended the Grotta Lighthouse. So we did, and low and behold, Northern Lights! I took a picture with my DSLR but since it was my first time with a professional camera and I didn’t have the infinity zoom feature on my lens, the photograph came out blurry. However, I am extremely proud of it.

            </ul>
            <p>Also if you don’t mind missing out on a little bit of the light, go to Iceland for New Years, it was by far the best New Year's of my life. There are fireworks everywhere and there are so many parties. We were able to score free tickets to the New Year's Harpa party and check out an awesome performance from an Icelandic rapper (he was great!). During the countdown be sure to go to one of Iceland’s many bonfires! We stayed mainly around Reykjavik. If I were do it again, I would definitely divide my time between eastern Iceland (Reykjavik) and western Iceland (more towards Vik). Around that area you have a shorter drive to “Europe’s largest glacier” and you have access to the black sand beach as well as more beautiful waterfalls.

              Pictured below, my friends & I explored "Dyrhólaey". At least that's the name that showed up on our google maps. As seen below, it's an awesome cliff that has probably popped up in shows and movies. My friend is a very athletic individual and he actually did a flip on this dangerous terrain (because why not?). Overall, this is definitely a spot to goto.
            </p>

            <p>One word of caution, the food, gas, and living is not cheap here but be sure to splurge once in a while, for others just make food in your hostels/airbnb kitchen. Luckily lodging was relatively cheap for us since we had eight guys. So if you have the ability to travel in a large group be sure to rent cars and live in an airbnb. All of the airbnbs we stayed at had hot tubs, great views and superb locations for the cost of approximately $30 per person per night. Also note that the water stinks! It smells of sulfur (rotten eggs) so brushing is a bizarre experience.

            <p>Lastly, be sure to visit the Blue Lagoon. It really is amazing. If you have saved up enough to get you through, EAT AT THE LAVA LOUNGE AND ORDER THE $70 full lunch. It was the best meal of my life. It was expensive but most definitely worth it!
