    <p>	This page is geared towards people starting to get into cooking, because they moved to a new city, started college or are just looking to add to their arsenal of awesome skills! Welcome! </p>
    <p>
      As with most people, I freaking love food! However, my relationship with it over the years has changed a bit. In college, I didn’t really understand how it affected my body and my mind. I was simply a black hole for cookies, pizza, and whatever else the University of Delaware dining hall could conjure up (nutella marshmallow pizza, I am looking at you). However as every young adult does, I moved to a new city and being all alone without a meal pass, I am now forced to cook food. It wasn’t like I didn’t cook in college, but that was mostly just ramen (fancier instant noodles), baked tyson chicken strips, mac and cheese, and other easy and definitely not healthy recipes. However as any 23 year old has realized, your body can’t handle the alcohol or the calories it used to in college. Hence, I have started paying a bit more attention to these demon calories and have been able to cook simple, easy, and for the most part, delicious meals.

      For food, and like in most things, I believe in the K.I.S.S model. Keep it simple stupid is great advice for everything, especially cooking. The subpages under “Food” aren’t the typical, “Breakfast”, “Lunch”, and “Dinner”. Instead, I went with “For Future” and “For Present”. Essentially saying “Meal Prep” or “Food for immediate consumption”. That’s how I cook so that’s how I elected to display this information. If it turns out to be bad design then I might change it but I kind of like it.
    </p>
    <p>Feel free to click through the current content. I want to eventually add tags such as, “healthy”, “fat enriched”, “keto-friendly”, “protein”, etc. All of the recipes listed have the macro nutrient facts and calories so that should help you make better decisions!  I have also uploaded the recipes on myfitnesspal as well!

    Also, if you feel like it, please bookmark this website foodmoneyandtravel.com, I’ll try to hook you up with some interesting content and if not, do it just so you can see a guy trying to write, code and document his adventures at the same time
