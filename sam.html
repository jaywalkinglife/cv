            South America, the land that was previously best friend with Africa but after a bitter fight, relocated considerably west. As far as continents go, South America is a top contender in terms of food, people, history and especially food.
   All jokes aside, South America contains vast deserts, diverse forests, innovative cities, and most remarkably, very unique animals. South America is also the closest continent to landmasses such as the Galapagos Islands (the inspiration for Charles Darwin for the theory of evolution) and Easter Island(s).
   Another remarkable aspect of this continent is that most of its population speak a single language: Spanish (except for Brazil and a few remote tribes). Hence if you speak Spanish you will be rocking it here! We unfortunately speak very little spanish so we were at a bit of a handicap at the time of the visit.
          </p>
        </div>

      <section class="key-tips">
        <h4>Key tips for South America</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Speak Spanish: Speaking spanish in this continent is not just great for ensuring a fully immersive travel experience, but it will also come in handy when time comes to barter for souvenirs and finding local hidden deals. It also disarms the locals and you’ll move through your travels more effortlessly. If you cannot get yourself to learn spanish in time, try to convince one of your many spanish-speaking friends to join in your amazing adventures to South America.
          </li>
          <li>Book Hostels: Booking hostels is not only great because of the price but it is also great for socializing with other like-minded individuals. And most often, the reception/host are locals of the area and they can recommend some kick-ass places where the locals eat and party. One big drawback with hostels are their bathrooms. If you value a great bathroom for your stay, hostels are just not going to be your cup of tea. Most of the time, it is difficult to find a clean and comfortable bathroom, and sometimes you get stuck with a shared bathroom. But if you are willing to sacrifice small comforts, the big payoff is almost always unintended friendships and culture lessons from your fellow travellers. This pretty much applies to all hostels in all continents.
          </li>
          <li>Use “Easy ME” instead of Uber. “Lift” doesn’t really exist in South America or atleast it was not there when we visited. Uber is usually more expensive than their native app, “Easy ME”. It’s kind of confusing because there are three versions of the app: “Easy”, “Easy ME” and “Easy Driver”. It has a yellow logo with a black outline of a car with a “wifi signal” coming out it. We used this service at the tail end of the trip and I wished we found out about it sooner! The best part: you don’t have to speak spanish to use this app. Also, this app sets the price range upfront and you can choose to pay in cash rather than in the app (super helpful!). I am not sure if this app is available all over South America but it was definitely a HUGE help in Peru!
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>As with the other pages, I will add more continent specific recommendations as my travels continue! :) </p>

          Peru is the home to one of the 7 wonders of the world: Macchu Pichuu. Although the country has earned its travel glory because of Macchu Pichuu, Peru so much more than that. Peruvian cuisine boasts some of the best food I have ever experienced in my travels.
          Locals told us about a vague story about a guy who was a son of a famous politician in Peru and that politician sent him over to France to study abroad. Upon his return, he was expected to take part in the local politics with his father. However, he chose to pursue his passion of cooking and instead opened over 5 different franchises which showcase Peruvian cuisine with a bit of French influence. During our travels-without our knowledge-we ate at two of those five famous restaurant chains: Tantas and Papachos. Both of these franchises were started by that dude. The burgers and the meat platter at Papachos were mesmerizing. Tantas had an amazing quinoa risotto and absolutely the best marinated chicken in the world. Before turning this into an all out review for my favorite peruvian restaurants, let me just end with this: the food is TERRIFIC in Peru.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than amazing food, when “thirsty”, DRINK PISCO SOUR! It's a Peruvian specialty and it is delicious. They have variations in flavor which were all my favorite over at Papachos. Besides Pisco Sour, we mainly drank “Malta Negra” (the darkest beer they had). If you are looking for non-alcoholic drinks, look no further than the many juices that they offer. Every time we ordered juice at any restaurant, it was freshly squeezed, unadulterated fruit juice. As you can imagine, that was very refreshing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below are pictures of Tantas at the Lacomar Mall in Lima, Peru (see the awesome view from the window). The mall is located on a cliff with stunning views and everything relevant nearby. If you don't feel like shopping (which is how we felt), you can go paraglide off the cliffs for approximately $70.00 (230 soles, all cash). The picture with two giant people making out is called the Love Park, also located near the Lacomar mall. It seemed everything fun and interesting is located near Larcomar mall. Another area in Lima that is worth a look is the "Barranco Area" (right next to the Miraflores area). Both of these areas are pretty safe and sport an awesome night scene (two clubs to check out during your visit are listed below)

            Below is Cusco, Peru. Cusco is much different than Lima. It feels, in a way, more authentic than Lima, and it is absolutely gorgeous. I am sure if you are deciding to go here then you have researched top things to see/do in cusco, and what you got was "Centro Historico De Cusco". Do yourself a favor and go to Papachos near the center and order the shareable (don't share though) meat platter, sit on the balcony, drink some pisco sour, and enjoy the view
          </p>
          <ul class="gallery">

            Besides drinking and eating, Peru also has great tours. Only book the Macchu Picchu tickets ahead of time online. Besides that everything is cheaper by actually going into the tour guide HQ (either in Lima or Cusco). To learn how to purchase the Macchu Picchu tickets, read the paragraph below, if you are already familiar with the process than you can skip it!
          </p>
          <p>
          Okay so you are ready to go to Machu Picchu, but you don’t know how to purchase the tickets. First you got to get there. If you do a tour then most likely, you will have a guide taking care of everything from Cusco. I am going to assume that you are doing the work on your own and aren't utilizing a preset tour for this (I think it's cheaper this way).
          </p>
          <p>
            So to get to Macchu Piccu, you've got many options. I would recommend getting a taxi over to Ollantaymbo from Cusco and then taking the train from there to Aguas Calientes(this option is the cheapest). To get back you would do the same thing
          </p>
          <p> We took a train from the "Puno" station. This is nearby Cusco by a 30-40 minute taxi ride. From there we took a train to Aguas Calientes (with a pit stop at Ollantayambo). On our way back, we just took a train ride to Ollantayambo and took a taxi cab back to Cusco. This is also a great option, but you'd spend a little bit more money but it definitely gives a peace of mind in terms of getting to Macchu Picchu on time. We didn't really stop at Ollantaymbo (even though that was the original plan) because all it really has is more ruins, and after seeing Macchu Picchu, it just becomes more of the same to the untrained eyes (ours). SIDE NOTE: We used Peru Rail and it was a pretty nice train ride. I'd imagine it's the same with Inca rails.
          </p>
          <p>
            After figuring out how to get to Macchu Picchu, you have to still purchase the actual tickets to enter the site. I was originally baffled by this process because it was somewhat bizarre. There are other blogs out there that dedicate entire posts on this so I won’t go too much into detail with that. However, if you are booking ahead of time, you might be able to score the Huayanna mountain (Wuayanna Picchu) with the citadel (usually featured in everyone’s profile pics). Wuayanna Picchu is very popular and we didn’t have the foresight to purchase four months in advance so we actually bought the higher, “Montana Machu Picchu” add-on. You can also just purchase the citadel if you don’t want to exhaust yourself on this vacation. However, I would definitely recommend one of these add-ons if you want to squeeze some great views out of this trip. With this selection, you also get to pick times. I would recommend doing it earlier. Earlier you do it, the fewer the tourists. The big drawback is that the earlier you do it, greater the chances of clouds disrupting your views. We went in the first time slot and the clouds blocked our views during our ascend on the mountain. After a 20-30 minute wait up top, the clouds began clearing up and they were completely gone during our descend. My recommendations would be to do Wuayanna Picchu. I personally did not do it but everyone I spoke with, absolutely loved it. I loved our trek up Montana Macchu Picchu but it is an unexpected challenge and the trek seemed infinite at the time.
          </p>
          <p>SIDE NOTE: There are no bathrooms or water places in the actual site. So bring lots of water (& snacks) to last you through your visit at the site. Also, you get a re-entry with your ticket (just confirm before you leave though) for a bathroom break and some food. Also as far as I know, they don't really kick you out after you timeslot is completed, so take your time
          </p>
          <p>Also pictured below is the small city/village of Aguas Calientes. It is located in the sacred valley and it's called "Aguas Calientes" because of the natural hot water springs located at the location. This is the base camp for Macchu Picchu, mostly people just do a day trip from Cusco to Macchu Picchu but I would recommend spending a night in Aguas Calientes. Especially, if you have time, be sure relax in the natural hot springs after your climb/bus ride</p>

          <p>
          So, after you have visited Machu Picchu and possibly one of the two mountains as an add-on, and you are looking for a bigger challenge, check out “Rainbow Mountain”. It’s approximately 5200 meters (roughly 17,000 feet). So experts (locals) recommend that you acclimate to Cusco’s climate (roughly 12,000 feet) for two days and then trek Rainbow Mountain. So the ideal itinerary would be to land in Cusco, travel to Machu Picchu (approximately 8000 feet), return to Cusco, then stay and party in Cusco for a day or two, then climb Rainbow Mountain. This way, you mitigate the chances of getting altitude sickness and will be better suited for the climb. However, we did it the wrong way, we landed in Cusco and did the Rainbow Mountain tour the next day (8 hours to acclimate). There weren’t enough coca leaves in Peru to solve the pounding headaches and the non-stop nausea. So after paying dearly and almost passing out several times on the trek we made it there and back. It is definitely a grueling trek but it is well worth it. If you do decide to trek rainbow mountain, beware of the hot and cold parts of the trek. On minute you could be in a T-shirt and the next it would be freezing. So definitely wear layers that you can take off and stuff in your day pack. Also, obviously, pack water and lot of snacks.
          </p>

          <p>Overall, Peru is awesome. It has great views and amazing food (& drinks). If you have the opportunity, definitely go! It’s a great country to get your feet wet with the continent. If you speak spanish you’ll definitely be safer and more immersed in the country, so learn spanish.
